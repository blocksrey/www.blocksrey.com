<p>One of the most peculiar dreams I have had in recent times was a dream that began with three people going to an unknown place at night. There were dirt roads and a lot of cornfields surrounding the area, it was quite dark and foggy. We were walking along one of the dirt roads behind the building, and things took a turn for the worse.</p><h2 id="Dream Sequence">Dream Sequence</h2>
<p>We went into this place, and I can't remember what it was, but we were either robbing it or causing some sort of trouble. But we went in and ran into one of the workers there, an older man in his 50s. We got into a scuffle with him, and he wanted us out of there. I remember running to the front door, which was a glass door, and all of us ended up in front of the place where we jogged off outside.</p><p>For some reason, there were a lot of people around me, and there were lights and commotion, like yelling, and I remember a giant figure approaching us from the distance and grabbing people. It then grabbed me, and I was lying on top of it along with everyone else, and shortly I blacked out.</p><p>I then remember being inside some kind of large complex of dirty underground "hallways" if you will. These complex tunnels were tall and seemingly dug out by hand, but it was so weird because of how organized they were. There were a bunch of shelves placed on both sides of these walls of these dug out hallways with random accessories such as spices, canned foods, and books? This is all while we were on top of this tall creature, mind you.</p><h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I eventually encountered some kind of rectangular piece of material, either glass or sheet of metal or plastic? I can't remember, but this was a common trend within these tunnels. But after breaking through the sheet, I was alarmed by the discovery that behind this sheet was a very small furnished room, by no means fancy. In fact, it was littered with ancient looking chairs, picture frames, etc. Despite it looking somewhat organized, it didn't make sense why such a room would be placed there. None of this made any sense. I then heard a distant screech of some sort, or yell of a womanly voice, mature voice, idk. But then I started to feel these incredibly strong thuds getting closer and closer to me. I felt that there was no way that I'd be in danger seeing as how complex this maze was, there was no way anyone could've found me. But these thuds got louder, and louder, until the point I realized that I'm being approached by this monster, and extraordinarily fast. It was when I made sight with this creature as it barged through the opening to the catacombs and into my room where I blacked out again. This dream was incredibly odd in the sensations I experienced, it was unlike most dreams I've ever had and quite unforgettable. But yes, very odd and fucking disturbing to all hell.</p></div><a href="Bad Dream Encounter/Bad Dream Encounter.plg">Plog Source File</a>
