<title>Blog Page Generator</title>
<h2><p>Blog Page Generator</p></h2><p>	I recently thought about documenting my software projects for the first time. The idea is that you can take some plain text and parse it into a CSS-styled HTML page. I would probably have some simple syntax for including links and pictures however, but the idea is that it's basic.

	Currently, I'm storing each blog page in a contained folder where assets can be bunched up, things like pictures, audio, source code, etc. The actual blog's text will be stored in the page.txt file as plain English text and will be parsed by a program I will make in Lua. Basically just iterate through the blog folders and parse the page.txt file, and then create an index.html file from each one.

	What is the goal of this project? Well, first of all, I'm not a good writer and I want to improve. Second, I heard that putting your ideas on paper helps you gain a true understanding of what you're doing. So in summary it's for self-improvement with the incentive of outsiders being able to view my work, which is something I enjoy greatly.</p>
