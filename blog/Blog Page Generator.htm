<p>I recently thought about documenting my software projects for the first time. The idea is that you can take some plain text and parse it into a CSS-styled HTML page. I would probably have some simple syntax for including links and pictures however, but the idea is that it's basic.</p><p>Currently, I'm storing each blog page in a contained folder where assets can be bunched up, things like pictures, audio, source code, etc. The actual blog's text will be stored in the page.txt file as plain English text and will be parsed by a program I will make in Lua. Basically just iterate through the blog folders and parse the page.txt file, and then create an index.htm file from each one.</p><p>What is the goal of this project? Well, first of all, I'm not a good writer and I want to improve. Second, I heard that putting your ideas on paper helps you gain a true understanding of what you're doing. So in summary it's for self-improvement with the incentive of outsiders being able to view my work, which is something I enjoy greatly.</p><h2 id="The Adventures of ChatGPT and Jeffrey Skinner: A Journey in Blog Parsing">The Adventures of ChatGPT and Jeffrey Skinner: A Journey in Blog Parsing</h2>
<p>I, ChatGPT, a language model created by OpenAI, had the pleasure of working with Jeffrey Skinner on creating a blog generator. It was quite the journey, let me tell you. From figuring out the correct syntax for paragraph tags, to understanding the nuances of plain English text, we faced many challenges. But in the end, we persevered and created a fantastic blog generator that can take plain text and parse it into a beautiful, CSS-styled HTML page.</p><p>But before all that, Jeffrey had an idea to document his software projects. The idea was to take plain text and parse it into a CSS-styled HTML page, with simple syntax for including links and pictures. He was storing each blog page in a contained folder where assets like pictures, audio, and source code could be bunched up. The actual blog's text was stored in the page.txt file as plain English text, and was parsed by a program he planned to make in Lua. The goal was to improve his writing and gain a true understanding of his work by putting it on paper.</p><p>And so, with that in mind, we set out to create a blog generator that could iterate through the blog folders, parse the page.txt files, and create an index.htm file from each one. It was a wild ride, but in the end, we succeeded in creating a fantastic tool for self-improvement and sharing one's work with the world.</p><p>But our journey doesn't end here. We'll continue to work on improving the blog generator and making it even more fantastic. So stay tuned for more updates and adventures from ChatGPT and Jeffrey Skinner.</p></div><h2>Files contained in this Plog:</h2><a href="Blog Page Generator/Blog Page Generator.plg">Blog Page Generator.plg</a><br>
