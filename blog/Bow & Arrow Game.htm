<title>Bow & Arrow Game</title>
<h2><p>Bow & Arrow Game</p></h2>
<p>	Around 2017 I received great inspiration from the Roblox game known as Bowmen. The game felt really good because of how responsive and accurate the character controller was. Turns out all of the physics in that game aren't handled by Roblox, but rather built from scratch. This allows for precise control over how you want the game to feel.</p>
