And I've taken many things for granted during my time abroad. The simple action of being able to say "hi" to your parents being one of those them. Upon exploring my Google Drive in efforts of finding files for a recent <b>data incident</b>, I noticed files in my Wii backup folders from 2010. In there were very, very old recordings and pictures of my dad and sisters, dated to Jan 2, 2008, 4:00 AM (JST). I couldn't even believe what I was seeing, and upon opening the video, seeing my dad there, I couldn't bare but shedding tears. I miss you guys. Time sure flies.</p><p><div align=center><video height=140 src="Discovering Lost Memories/SUNP0001.AVI" controls loop></video></div></p><img src=../shared/barbed_wire.gif><table align=right><td><h3>FILES CONTAINED IN THIS PLOG</h3>* <a href="Discovering Lost Memories/Discovering Lost Memories.plg">Discovering Lost Memories.plg</a><br>* <a href="Discovering Lost Memories/SUNP0001.AVI">SUNP0001.AVI</a><br></td></table><div align=center><font size=1><img src=../shared/barrio_logo_huge.gif align=texttop><a href=../puniko/index.htm>Copyright (c) 2023 Jeffrey Skinner.
