As you might've known, I've been in Japan for about a year now. And I've taken many things for granted during my time abroad. The simple action of being able to say "hi" to your parents being one of those them. Upon exploring my Google Drive in efforts of finding files for a recent *data incident*, I noticed files in my Wii backup folders from 2010. In there were very, very old recordings and pictures of my dad and sisters, dated to Jan 2, 2008, 4:00 AM (JST). I couldn't even believe what I was seeing, and upon opening the video, seeing my dad there, I couldn't bare but shedding tears. I miss you guys. Time sure flies.
