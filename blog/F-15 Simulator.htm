I wanted to create something that would not only be fun, but also be a very realistic representation of what it's like to pilot one of the most formidable fighter jets ever made. So, I put in the time, effort, and resources to create an F-15 simulator that is as close to reality as possible.</p><p><div align=center><img height=140 src="F-15 Simulator/zoomed shot.jpg"></div></p><p>The first thing that I focused on was the physics engine. I never wanted to create an experience that was oversimplified or just a graphical representation of the F-15. Instead, I wanted to create something that would accurately and realistically replicate what it's like to fly this aircraft. So, I put a lot of emphasis on proper lift, drag, and pressures. This included figuring out how to simulate the breaking of the sound barrier in a way that felt truly authentic.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges in creating a sound barrier simulator was figuring out how to accurately mimic the turbulence that pilots go through when breaking the sound barrier. I spent countless hours analyzing data and testing different scenarios until I felt confident that the simulator was replicating the experience as closely as possible. The end result was a hyper-realistic audio and visual experience that really felt like flying an F-15.</p><p>The next challenge was creating the VR mode. As virtual reality has become increasingly popular, I knew that I wanted to include this feature as an option for players. This meant testing various VR headsets and figuring out how to integrate the technology seamlessly into the simulator.</p><p>Finally, I put a lot of time and effort into sound design. I wanted the audio in the simulator to be as accurate and realistic as possible. So, I spent hours editing F-15 audio clips until I had a good representation of the various sounds that the aircraft makes. When combined, the audio in the simulator truly gives you the experience of being near an F-15. When the jets pass by, their engines roar and you can feel the impact of the noise on your body. It's all of these subtle details that make the simulator so engrossing and truly a remarkable experience.</p><p>In conclusion, creating an F-15 simulator was definitely a challenging and time-intensive process. But, the end result was worth it. When people try out the simulator, their reactions are always the same: they are truly amazed by how realistic it is. I am very proud of what I have created and I can't wait to see more people try it out.</p><p><div align=center><video height=140 src="F-15 Simulator/sound design.mp4" controls loop></video></div></p><img src=../shared/barbed_wire.gif><table align=right><td><h3>FILES CONTAINED IN THIS PLOG</h3>* <a href="F-15 Simulator/F-15 Simulator.plg">F-15 Simulator.plg</a><br>* <a href="F-15 Simulator/close pass.mp4">close pass.mp4</a><br>* <a href="F-15 Simulator/sound design.mp4">sound design.mp4</a><br>* <a href="F-15 Simulator/zoomed shot.jpg">zoomed shot.jpg</a><br></td></table><div align=center><font size=1><img src=../shared/barrio_logo_huge.gif align=texttop><a href=../puniko/index.htm>Copyright (c) 2023 Jeffrey Skinner.
