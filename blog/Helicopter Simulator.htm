It was a great chance to test my skills in coding and physics, and I had the opportunity to explore quaternions, which was an excellent learning experience.</p><p>First, I started by building a basic helicopter model with blades that could rotate and features that would allow realistic movements. I created a script that would determine how the helicopter moves based on every input received from the user.</p><p>Next, I started incorporating the physics of helicopter flying, including the swashplate, which enables the blades to tilt from side to side, and the rotor that produces the lift. I used a physics engine that took into account the mass of the helicopter, the shape of the blades, the speed, and the air pressure.</p><p>To make the simulator realistic and engaging, I added sound and visual effects of stress when the blades come under too much pressure. These effects were triggered by the movement of the swashplate, which tilted the blades too much or by rapid acceleration.</p><p>One of the most significant challenges of this project was the creation of an AI helicopter that would follow the player and aim to shoot them down. I created a script that allowed the AI helicopter to track the player based on their location. It took into account the speed and direction of the helicopter, as well as the player's position in the game world.</p><p>Overall, designing a helicopter simulator in Roblox was an exciting and insightful experience that helped me to develop my coding skills. It allowed me to learn about the physics of helicopter flying, the use of quaternions in game development, and how to create an immersive gaming experience for players.</p><img src=../shared/barbed_wire.gif><table align=right><td><h3>FILES CONTAINED IN THIS PLOG</h3>* <a href="Helicopter Simulator/Helicopter Simulator.plg">Helicopter Simulator.plg</a><br>* <a href="Helicopter Simulator/flight.mp4">flight.mp4</a><br></td></table><div align=center><font size=1><img src=../shared/barrio_logo_huge.gif align=texttop><a href=../puniko/index.htm>Copyright (c) 2023 Jeffrey Skinner.
