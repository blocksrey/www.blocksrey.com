Once upon a time in the wonderful world of Robloxia, two of the biggest games had a bit of a tiff. You see, Phantom Forces and Jailbreak were both extremely popular and successful games on the platform. But then, AxisAngle, the mastermind behind Phantom Forces, noticed something a little fishy going on in Jailbreak. As it turned out, that sneaky little asimo3089 had stolen some of AxisAngle's fancy inverse kinematics code! How dare he!

Well, AxisAngle was not about to let this slide. As one of the finest mathematicians and game developers on the platform, he knew his code was top notch and deserved to be compensated for. So he went to asimo3089, hand held out, and demanded compensation.

And guess what? Asimo actually paid up! Maybe he realized that he was no match for AxisAngle's mathematical wizardry. Or maybe he just felt bad for stealing in the first place. Either way, AxisAngle got a nice chunk of change from the whole ordeal.

But let's be real here, who steals code from someone else's game? Asimo, you sly little fox, you should know better! Maybe next time, he'll think twice before trying to steal from the best of the best.

The end.
