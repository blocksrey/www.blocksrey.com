One of the projects that I recently took on was creating a missile guidance system that used thrust vectoring. The goal of this system was to create a completely physically-based system where the only things being controlled were the thrust and angle of the thruster.</p><p>Developing this system was a complex process that required a deep understanding of mathematics and physics. The thrust vectoring system is based on the fundamental principles of Newton's laws of motion. The basic idea behind it is that by controlling the direction of the thrust, you can control the direction of the missile.</p><p><div align=center><img height=140 src="Missile Guidance in Roblox/recover.gif"></div></p><p>The first thing that I needed to do was create a model for the missile. This involved understanding the physical properties of the missile and how it behaves in different conditions. One of the challenges I faced was trying to create a model that was both accurate and simplified enough to work within the constraints of Roblox.</p><p>After creating the missile model, I began working on the thrust vectoring system. This involved creating a set of equations that would allow me to calculate the necessary thrust and angle of the thruster based on the current state of the missile.</p><p>The math involved in this process was quite complex. I had to take into account a variety of different factors such as the velocity of the missile, its orientation, and the forces acting upon it. I also had to factor in the fact that the missile could be moving in different directions at any given time.</p><p>Once I had developed the mathematical model for the thrust vectoring system, I started testing it out in Roblox. At first, there were some issues that needed to be ironed out. The missile was not always behaving in the way that I wanted it to, and there were some bugs that needed to be fixed.</p><p>However, after spending several hours tweaking the system and making adjustments, I finally had a missile guidance system that worked as intended. I was able to control the missile's direction by adjusting the thrust and angle of the thruster, and the system was completely physically-based.</p><p>The final product was incredibly satisfying. It was amazing to see a mathematical model come to life in the game, and to be able to control the behavior of the missile in such a precise and accurate way. The entire project was a great learning experience, and I gained a new appreciation for the power and flexibility of Roblox as a platform for creating complex systems and simulations.</p><p><div align=center><img height=140 src="Missile Guidance in Roblox/accuracy.gif"></div></p><img src=../shared/barbed_wire.gif><table align=right><td><h3>FILES CONTAINED IN THIS PLOG</h3>* <a href="Missile Guidance in Roblox/Missile Guidance in Roblox.plg">Missile Guidance in Roblox.plg</a><br>* <a href="Missile Guidance in Roblox/accuracy.gif">accuracy.gif</a><br>* <a href="Missile Guidance in Roblox/recover.gif">recover.gif</a><br></td></table><div align=center><font size=1><img src=../shared/barrio_logo_huge.gif align=texttop><a href=../puniko/index.htm>Copyright (c) 2023 Jeffrey Skinner.
