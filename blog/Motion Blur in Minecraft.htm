Through inspiration of user-created Optifine shaders, I always wanted to know how they worked. Unfortunately Minecraft shaders are THE SINGLE WORST documented thing on the Internet. At the time of me trying to learn Optifine and GLSL shaders, the only resource I had was a few YouTube videos and experimentation through trial and error. Even to this day, there really isn't much documentation on Optifine shaders aside from one really good Discord server.</p><p align=left>	The first shaders I ever made were pretty much color-grading shaders which essentially map the color to another in order to change the feeling of the visuals. It was extremely basic and requires little to no knowledge about the graphics pipeline and shaders. I wanted to make something better and I would continue experiment and grow my skill for a few months until I was able to make a depth of field shader.</p><img src=../shared/barbed_wire.gif><table align=right><td><h3>FILES CONTAINED IN THIS PLOG</h3><a href="Motion Blur in Minecraft/Motion Blur in Minecraft.plg">Motion Blur in Minecraft.plg</a><br><a href="Motion Blur in Minecraft/photo_2022-08-08_05-18-06.jpg">photo_2022-08-08_05-18-06.jpg</a><br><a href="Motion Blur in Minecraft/photo_2022-08-08_05-18-08.jpg">photo_2022-08-08_05-18-08.jpg</a><br><a href="Motion Blur in Minecraft/photo_2022-08-08_05-18-25.jpg">photo_2022-08-08_05-18-25.jpg</a><br></td></table><div align=center><font size=1><img src=../shared/barrio_logo_huge.gif align=texttop><a href=../puniko/index.htm>&copy 2022, Jeffrey Skinner.
