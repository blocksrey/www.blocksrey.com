The colors were vibrant and the shadows seemed real, I was captivated by the sheer beauty of it all. I knew right then and there that I had to learn how to create them. Little did I know that this journey would lead me down a path of frustration and despair.</p><p>I started off by watching a few YouTube videos on the topic, hoping to gain some insight and understanding. But as I delved deeper, I realized that the lack of documentation on Optifine shaders was astounding. It was as if the universe was trying to tell me to give up, but I refused to give in.</p><p>I started experimenting with color grading shaders, hoping to create something beautiful. It was a simplistic approach but it was a start, and I persevered. Slowly but surely my knowledge began to grow, and I was able to create more advanced shaders, such as depth of field and motion blur.</p><p>As for the depth of field shader, it was an incredible achievement for me. The blurring effect gave the visuals a realistic touch, and the players were in awe of my creation. However, I wasn't satisfied with just this, I craved more, and delved deeper into the technical aspects of shaders.</p><p>Matrix operation hell was what awaited me when I attempted to create the motion blur shader. It was a grueling process, taking into consideration depth, player speed, camera orientation and more. The calculations were complex, and the code was a mess. But, I persevered, and eventually accomplished what I thought was impossible.</p><p>In the end, the struggle was worth it. The journey taught me a great deal about myself and my abilities. Through the frustration and the setbacks, I gained knowledge that I never thought was possible. My love for Optifine shaders continues to grow, and I still strive to create more amazing visual effects. So if there's one thing I've learned from this experience, it's that with determination and persistence, anything is possible, even when the resources are scarce.</p><img src=../shared/barbed_wire.gif><table align=right><td><h3>FILES CONTAINED IN THIS PLOG</h3>* <a href="Motion Blur in Minecraft/Motion Blur in Minecraft.plg">Motion Blur in Minecraft.plg</a><br>* <a href="Motion Blur in Minecraft/photo_2022-08-08_05-18-06.jpg">photo_2022-08-08_05-18-06.jpg</a><br>* <a href="Motion Blur in Minecraft/photo_2022-08-08_05-18-08.jpg">photo_2022-08-08_05-18-08.jpg</a><br>* <a href="Motion Blur in Minecraft/photo_2022-08-08_05-18-25.jpg">photo_2022-08-08_05-18-25.jpg</a><br></td></table><div align=center><font size=1><img src=../shared/barrio_logo_huge.gif align=texttop><a href=../puniko/index.htm>Copyright (c) 2023 Jeffrey Skinner.
