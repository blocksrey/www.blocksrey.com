<title>Old Account Emails</title><link href=../shared/style.css rel=stylesheet><a href=index.htm>Backtrack</a><h1 align=center><a href="Old Account Emails.htm">Old Account Emails</a></h1><p>I have a fond memory of exploring my mother's emails back in 2018. I can't quite recall the exact reason why I was doing it, but I think it had something to do with trying to find the login information for my original Roblox account.</p><p>You see, for every Roblox account created under a specific email, you're able to recover the passwords for all of those accounts as long as you have access to the email. Back in the day, I used to use my mother's email address for signing up for pretty much anything. It's possible that I even used my grandmother's email address at some point. But that's beside the point.</p><p>So, I sent a password reset request to her email and was able to see all of the accounts linked to it. And, sure enough, my original Roblox account was one of them. I even found the original Club Penguin sign-up and membership information, as well as emails for Roblox Builders Club and Battlefield Heroes. I was absolutely mindblown by this discovery.</p><p>I still have possession of my original account sign-up emails under my mother's email address. I'm sure there are even more hidden gems in there, like Habbo Hotel, Miniclip, and Planet Minecraft. Those were truly the days.</p><img src=../shared/barbed_wire.gif><table align=right><td><h3>FILES CONTAINED IN THIS PLOG</h3>* <a href="Old Account Emails/Old Account Emails.plg">Old Account Emails.plg</a><br></td></table><div align=center><font size=1><img src=../shared/barrio_logo_huge.gif align=texttop><a href=../puniko/index.htm>Copyright (c) 2023 Jeffrey Skinner.
