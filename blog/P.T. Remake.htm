Remake</title><p>A while back, I had a notion that it was possible to create 3D graphics using the Love2D game engine. I knew for certain it could be done, but I had no idea that it could be executed so efficiently that it could be used in a practical setting. My friend Trey, also known as AxisAngle, went on to develop a fully functional deferred renderer using Love2D. He achieved this by utilizing the built-in access to depth-buffers and render targets, which were all built on top of OpenGL. I was surprised to learn that Love2D had access to OpenGL all along, and I had no idea.</p><p>After I shared my idea with Trey and explained what I wanted to do with his deferred renderer demo, I started writing on top of his code and adding some functionality, such as a character controller and dynamic meshes. Over time, I was able to create an incredibly immersive recreation of the P.T. demo scene. The audio was fantastic, even better than the original P.T., and the overall atmosphere was just incredibly creepy. The camera animations, audio, lighting, etc. were all top-notch. I could even write an entire section on just the flashlight alone, that's how in-depth it was.</p><p>Working on this project with Trey was an incredibly valuable learning experience for me, and I was truly impressed by what we were able to achieve.</p></div><h2>Files contained in this Plog:</h2><a href="P.T.
