<p>The powder in ramen contains salt and other seasonings, and the amount of powder used in relation to the amount of water can affect the strength of the seasoning and the overall flavor of the broth. A higher ratio of water to powder will result in a milder broth, while a lower ratio will result in a stronger broth. It's important to remember that the quality and types of ingredients used, the temperature and cooking time, and the method of preparation also play a role in the final broth.</p>
