Our story begins with a young man, Jeff, who was always fascinated by the unknown and had a desire to explore and document his experiences. When given the opportunity to travel to Spain for the first time, Jeff jumped at the chance and brought his video camera with him, determined to capture every moment of his journey."</p><p align=left>The video opens with Jeff sitting in his living room, smiling into the camera. He speaks in a cheerful tone, "Hey guys, it's me, Jeff. I just wanted to let you all know that I'm going on a business trip to Spain. I'm really excited, it's my first time going and I can't wait to explore and document my experiences."</p><p align=left>The video cuts to footage of Jeff on the plane, looking out the window with a look of wonder on his face. He speaks in a excited tone, "I'm on the plane right now, guys. The view is incredible, I can't believe I'm finally here."</p><p align=left>The video then cuts to footage of Jeff exploring the streets of Madrid, taking in the sights and sounds of the city. He speaks in a excited tone, "I just arrived in Madrid and it's incredible. The culture and energy here is so vibrant. I'm going to visit famous landmarks like the Prado Museum and the Retiro Park."</p><p align=left>The video continues to show footage of Jeff visiting small villages and meeting locals, hiking through the mountains and swimming in crystal clear lakes. He speaks in a excited tone, "I'm having the time of my life. The people are so friendly and welcoming, I feel like I've been here forever."</p><p align=left>But then, the video takes a dark turn as Jeff's tone changes to one of unease. He is shown stumbling upon a strange cave and feeling compelled to go inside. He speaks in a shaky tone, "I stumbled upon this cave and I don't know why, but I feel like I need to go inside. I'm turning on my camera and starting to explore."</p>

<p align=left>Jeff (on camera): "Guys, check this out. I just landed in Madrid and the city is incredible. The culture and energy here is just amazing. I can't wait to start exploring."</p><h3 id="00:02:30">00:02:30</h3>
<p align=left>Jeff (on camera): "I've been traveling further out of the city and into the countryside. I've met some locals who are showing me around and teaching me about their way of life. I've hiked through the mountains and swam in crystal clear lakes. It's been an unforgettable experience."</p><h3 id="00:03:45">00:03:45</h3>
<p align=left>Jeff (on camera): "I can't believe what I've found. I was out on a hike and stumbled upon a strange cave. I felt compelled to go inside, so I turned on my camera and began to explore. But what I found inside is unlike anything I've ever seen before. The cave is massive and seems to go on forever. The walls are covered in strange symbols and carvings. I can't understand what they mean, but they're incredibly detailed and intricate."</p><h3 id="00:04:59">00:04:59</h3>
<p align=left>Jeff (on camera): "As I ventured deeper into the cave, I began to feel a sense of unease. The air is thick and heavy, and I can hear strange noises in the distance. I'm not sure what's going on, but I feel like I need to keep going. Wait, what's that? A bright light in the distance. I'm walking towards it now...oh my god, it's a portal. I can't believe it. I've heard of people talking about portals and alternate dimensions before, but I never thought they were real. But</p><p align=left>recording himself saying things like "I don't know what's happening, but I have a bad feeling about this. The air is thick and heavy and it's getting harder to breathe. I can hear strange noises in the distance, like something is following me. I'm not sure if I should keep going but something is telling me to keep moving forward. Wait, what's that? A bright light in the distance. I'm walking towards it now...oh my god, it's a portal. I can't believe it. I've heard of people talking about portals and alternate dimensions before, but I never thought they were real. But here it is, right in front of me. I don't know what will happen if I go through it, but I have to know."</p><h3 id="NARRATOR">NARRATOR</h3>
<p align=left>As he steps through the portal, the footage becomes distorted and it's hard to make out what's happening. Jeff can be heard screaming and the camera shakes wildly. When the footage clears, Jeff is in a completely different place. He's surrounded by twisted and grotesque creatures, and the environment is constantly shifting and morphing around him. Jeff is clearly panicked and disoriented, and he can be heard saying things like "What the hell is happening? Where am I? This isn't real, this can't be real. I have to find a way out of here."</p><p align=left>As the days go on, Jeff's mental state deteriorates. He becomes increasingly paranoid and delusional, convinced that the creatures are watching him and that the reality around him is not real. He can be heard talking to himself, saying things like "I know they're out there, I can feel them. They're messing with my head. I have to find a way out before they drive me insane."</p><p align=left>The footage becomes increasingly disturbing as Jeff's condition worsens. He can be seen and heard in moments of extreme distress, his screams and cries for help echoing through the cave. Eventually, the footage cuts off abruptly, leaving the viewer to wonder what happened to Jeff. However he would be found by authorities 5 days after his dissapearance.</p>






<h3 id="JEFF'S AUDIO JOURNAL">JEFF'S AUDIO JOURNAL</h3>
<p align=left>I remember waking up in my hospital bed. My wife and kids were there beside me. I felt a wave of relief wash over me as I realized that it was all just a nightmare. But as I looked around my room, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but it was like everything was slightly different. My wife's face seemed a little too symmetrical, my kids too. Things weren't where they were supposed to be. Things are still wrong right now. *Wife goes into the room and says "Are you still recording yourself?! Give me that!"-</p><p align=left>I tried to push the thoughts out of my mind and go about my day as usual, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. I was on edge and paranoid, constantly checking and double checking things to make sure they were real. I couldn't trust my own memories or my own senses. I started to document everything in a journal, trying to make sense of what was happening to me.</p><h3 id="DETAILS">DETAILS</h3>
<p align=left>Jeff's journal, the pages filled with scribbles and musings of a mind slowly unraveling. The discovery of the footage and the journal raises more questions than answers. Who was Jeff and what really happened to him during his journey in Spain? Was he truly trapped in some kind of alternate reality or was it all just the ravings of a madman? One thing is for certain, the exploration of the unknown can have dangerous and deadly consequences.</p><img src=../blocksrey/barbed_wire.gif><table align=right><td><h3>FILES CONTAINED IN THIS PLOG</h3><a href="Potential Anomoly 1/Potential Anomoly 1.plg">Potential Anomoly 1.plg</a><br></td></table><div align=center><font size=1><img src=../blocksrey/barrio_logo_huge.gif align=texttop><a href=../puniko/index.htm>&copy 2022, Jeffrey Skinner.
