	Roblox vehicle physics, we all know it and hate it! At one point I was working for a Roblox startup known as BloopVille and we made it our goal to incorporate fantastic-feeling vehicle physics. Fortunately with a little bit of math and physics I was able to turn this dream into reality. First thing you should know about doing anything in Roblox is, don't use anything from Roblox! At the very maximum, just use Roblox for rendering and do all of the physics, networking replication, and game-play mechanics from scratch. This is because when working with Roblox's assets and core tools, you're forced to work on this high-level abstraction which really doesn't give you enough control that you want. Scripting solves this problem.
