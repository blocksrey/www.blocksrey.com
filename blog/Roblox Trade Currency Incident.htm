This was probably around 2010 or 2011, and at the time, there were two different types of in-game currency: Tix and Robux. There was also a market trading system where players could exchange Robux for Tix and vice versa.</p><p>Unfortunately, I made the grave mistake of engaging in this system without fully understanding it. I can't recall the exact amount, but I traded an absurdly large number of Robux for a measly few Tix. It's quite possible that I traded something like 5000 Robux for just 1 Tix. I remember shortly after that trade questioning my own sanity, thinking to myself "Where did all my Robux go?" But I don't really remember what happened after that.</p><p>Looking back on it now, I realize that even if I hadn't made that mistake, it wouldn't have mattered much in the grand scheme of things, as I likely lost my account password that same week. Ah, the memories of youth and poor decision making.</p></div><h2>Files contained in this Plog:</h2><a href="Roblox Trade Currency Incident/Roblox Trade Currency Incident.plg">Roblox Trade Currency Incident.plg</a><br>
