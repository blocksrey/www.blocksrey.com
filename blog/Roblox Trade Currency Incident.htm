<title>Roblox Trade Currency Incident</title>
<h2><p>Roblox Trade Currency Incident</p></h2><p>	Just like every other young chap, back in the day, I played A LOT of Roblox. This was probably in 2010 or 2011, but at the time. But as many of you may know, there were two currencies in Roblox at this time. Tix, and Robux. There was also a market trading system for exchanging Robux for Tix and visa versa. At this time I made the mistake of engaging in this system without knowing what the hell I was doing. I don't remember how much specifically, but I traded some outragesly large number of Robux for basically nickels and dimes. Like 5000 Robux for 1 Tix. I remember shortly after that questioning myself mentally, "That's weird, where's my Robux?" but I don't really remember what happened after that. But whether or not I had made this mistake, it wouldn't have mattered seeing as I likely lost my account password that same week.</p>
