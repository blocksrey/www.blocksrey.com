<p align=left>	I've always liked the look of the particle effects that AxisAngles developed. For those who don't know, he's the main developer of the game called Phantom Forces, a multiplayer FPS on Roblox with a massive following. Anyways, his particle effects are a good representation of why AxisAngles focus on detail and good-feeling game mechanics shine more than most other games out there. So what's special about his effects as opposed to others?<title>Snow Simulation in Roblox</title><link href="../blocksrey/style.css" rel=stylesheet><p align=left><a href="index.htm">Back</a></p><img src=../blocksrey/horizontal_rule.gif><p align=left><a href="Snow Simulation in Roblox.htm"><h1>Snow Simulation in Roblox</h1></a></p></p><img src=../blocksrey/horizontal_rule.gif><h3>Files contained in this Plog:</h3><p align=left><a href="Snow Simulation in Roblox/Snow Simulation in Roblox.plg">Snow Simulation in Roblox.plg</a></p><p align=left><a href="Snow Simulation in Roblox/out.mp4">out.mp4</a></p>
