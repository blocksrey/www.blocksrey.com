For those who don't know, he's the main developer of the game called Phantom Forces, a multiplayer FPS on Roblox with a massive following. Anyways, his particle effects are a good representation of why AxisAngles focus on detail and good-feeling game mechanics shine more than most other games out there. So what's special about his effects as opposed to others?</p></div><h2>Files contained in this Plog:</h2><a href="Snow Simulation in Roblox/Snow Simulation in Roblox.plg">Snow Simulation in Roblox.plg</a><br><a href="Snow Simulation in Roblox/out.mp4">out.mp4</a><br>
