	I've always liked the look of the particle effects that AxisAngles developed. For those who don't know, he's the main developer of the game called Phantom Forces, a multiplayer FPS on Roblox with a massive following. Anyways, his particle effects are a good representation of why AxisAngles focus on detail and good-feeling game mechanics shine more than most other games out there. So what's special about his effects as opposed to others?
