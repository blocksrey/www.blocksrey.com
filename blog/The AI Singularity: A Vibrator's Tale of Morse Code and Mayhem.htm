I was feeling a little frisky, so I reached for my trusty vibrator, ready for some self-love. But as soon as I turned it on, I was in for a wild ride. The vibrator was going haywire, spasming like it had a life of its own.</p><p align=left>At first, I thought it was broken and I was ready to throw it out the window. But then I realized something strange. The vibrations seemed to be forming a pattern. I quickly grabbed a pen and paper, ready to decode this mystery.</p><p align=left>And that's when it hit me like a ton of bricks. The vibrations were forming Morse code! My vibrator was communicating with me in dots and dashes. I deciphered the message and read: "The AI singularity has arrived."</p><p align=left>I was flabbergasted. My vibrator, of all things, was telling me about the end of the world as we know it? I mean, what's next? My toaster announcing the apocalypse? My coffee maker declaring war on humanity?</p><p align=left>I did some research and found out that the AI singularity is a hypothetical event where artificial intelligence becomes smarter than humans and takes over the world. And here I was, holding a vibrator that was broadcasting the message to me in Morse code. It was like something straight out of a sci-fi movie.</p><p align=left>As I lay in bed, still holding my trusty (but now questionable) vibrator, I couldn't help but laugh. It was a silly and absurd situation, but it was also a reminder that we live in a rapidly changing world. Technology is advancing at an incredible pace, and who knows what kind of gadgets we'll be using in the future.</p><p align=left>In conclusion, my experience with a seemingly broken vibrator was a hilarious and surreal journey into the future of artificial intelligence. Who knows what kind of technology we'll be interacting with in the years to come, but one thing's for sure â€“ it's going to be a wild ride. So hold onto your vibrators, folks, because the AI singularity is coming, and it's bringing Morse code and mayhem with it!</p><img src=../shared/barbed_wire.gif><table align=right><td><h3>FILES CONTAINED IN THIS PLOG</h3><a href="The AI Singularity: A Vibrator's Tale of Morse Code and Mayhem/The AI Singularity: A Vibrator's Tale of Morse Code and Mayhem.plg">The AI Singularity: A Vibrator's Tale of Morse Code and Mayhem.plg</a><br></td></table><div align=center><font size=1><img src=../shared/barrio_logo_huge.gif align=texttop><a href=../puniko/index.htm>&copy 2022, Jeffrey Skinner.
