## Overview
Welcome to blocksrey.com, the shittiest website on the web. It is a personal project made by a non-web-developer who is passionate about making a website that's intentionally shitty. The website is powered by nothing but shit, so don't expect much.

## History
blocksrey.com takes you back to the pre-2008 era of the web, when websites were simplistic, and GIFs were just 1 frame per second. Remember the days when HTML files used to have the extension ".htm"? blocksrey.com takes inspiration from this bygone era of the internet, and brings it back to life.

## Features
blocksrey.com is a minimalist website and does not boast many features. In fact, we're not even sure what features we can say it has. It's just a website that's there to be shitty. We hope you enjoy your stay, and please don't expect too much from us.

## Conclusion
Thank you for visiting blocksrey.com, the shittiest website on the web. We hope that our little corner of the internet provided you with a bit of nostalgia, or at the very least, a good laugh. If you have any suggestions or ideas for how we can make the website even shittier, please don't hesitate to let us know.
